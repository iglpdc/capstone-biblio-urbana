# Capstone project 

## Introduction

The goal is to count the number of times a given author appears in a
bibliography stored in a spreadsheet.

We can't use bash commands, like `cut`and `wc`, because the author field in
file in the spreadsheet uses commas to separate names in multi-author papers.

> the spreadsheet

## Questions

-Why the "O'Reilly" has double quotes while 'McClean' has single quotes?
